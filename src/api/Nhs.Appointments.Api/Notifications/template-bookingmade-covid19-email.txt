Date and time: ((date))
((time))

# If you need to cancel or change your appointment:

* visit https://www.nhs.uk/book-vaccine
* if you can't get online, call 119

# If you booked an appointment for people with a weakened immune system:

A healthcare professional will need to confirm that you have a weakened immune system before they can vaccinate you. They will ask about your health condition or treatment.

# It will help to bring either:

* an NHS letter describing the health condition that weakens your immune system
* or a repeat prescription or medicine box for the treatment that weakens your immune system
* or you can show your health record or medication history in the NHS App

You can check the summary of eligible health conditions and treatments at https://www.nhs.uk/book-vaccine

# What to do if you have had COVID-19 or symptoms of COVID-19:

If you have COVID-19, wait until you feel better before getting vaccinated.

You should also wait if you have a high temperature or feel particularly unwell with any illness. If you have recently got better from COVID-19, there is no need to delay getting vaccinated.
