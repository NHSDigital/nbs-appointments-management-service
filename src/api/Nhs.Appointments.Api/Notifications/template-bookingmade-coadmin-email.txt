# What to do if you have had COVID-19 or flu:

If you have COVID-19 or flu, wait until you feel better before getting vaccinated.

You should also wait if you have a high temperature or feel very unwell with any illness. If you have recently got better from COVID-19 or flu, there is no need to delay getting vaccinated.
